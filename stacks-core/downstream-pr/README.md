# Create downstream PR

When a PR is merged to:

- `master`: a PR is opened against `develop`, assigned to the user who made the last commit
- `develop`: a PR is opened against `next`, assigned to the user who made the last commit

If a PR already exists, or there are no changes between branches the action will exit successfully with no PR created.
